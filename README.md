## About

`bootstrap-npm-starter` is a GitHub template repository for creating new Bootstrap-powered npm projects, maintained by Bootstrap co-author @mdo. You can also use it as your own Bootstrap prototyping sandbox. It's built with Bootstrap v4 with plans to update for v5.

## Usage

Be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed before proceeding.

```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter
cd bootstrap-npm-starter

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass
npm run css-compile

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch

# Start local server (uses sirv-cli)
npm run server

# Watches Sass for changes and starts a local server
npm start
```

For the most straightforward development, open two Terminal tabs to execute `npm run server` and `npm run watch` at the same time.

Open <http://localhost:3000> to see the page in action.

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available to you in this starter repo. With the exception of `npm start` and `npm test`, the remaining scripts can be run from your command line with `npm run scriptName`.

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `server` | Starts a local server (<http://localhost:3000>) for development |
| `watch` | Automatically recompiles CSS as it watches the `scss` directory for changes |
| `css` | Runs `css-compile` and `css-prefix` |
| `css-compile` | Compiles source Sass into CSS |
| `css-lint` | Runs [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) against source Sass for code quality |
| `css-prefix` | Runs [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) on the compiled CSS |
| `css-purge` | Runs [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com) to remove CSS that is unused by `index.html` |
| `test` | Runs `css-lint` and `css`, in sequential order |
